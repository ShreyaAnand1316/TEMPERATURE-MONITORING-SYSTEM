OVERVIEW :


Project Overview :
The Temperature Monitoring System is a microcontroller-based project designed to monitor and display ambient temperature using a DHT11 sensor and a 16x2 LCD display. The Arduino Nano serves as the central controller, processing the temperature data collected by the DHT11 sensor. The real-time temperature readings are displayed on the LCD, making it an efficient and user-friendly solution for temperature monitoring.

This project is ideal for learning about interfacing sensors and displays with microcontrollers, as well as for practical use in various environments where temperature monitoring is essential.


Components Required :

1)Microcontroller: Arduino Nano (or equivalent).

2)Temperature Sensor: DHT11.

3)16x2 LCD Display: For displaying the temperature readings.

4)Potentiometer: For adjusting the contrast of the LCD.

5)Resistors: As needed for pull-up or circuit stabilization.

6)Connecting Wires: For connecting components.

7)Breadboard: (Optional, for prototyping).

8)Power Supply: 5V DC to power the Arduino Nano and other components.


USES AND APPLICATIONS :

-Use in homes, offices, or labs to keep track of ambient temperature.
Weather Stations:

-Integrate into a weather monitoring system to display temperature alongside other parameters.
Educational Projects:

-Great for beginners to learn microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and display control.
Industrial Use:

-Monitor temperature in warehouses, server rooms, or other sensitive environments.
DIY Automation:

-Include it as part of a home automation system for temperature-based control of HVAC systems.
Agriculture:

-Use for monitoring temperature in greenhouses or for crop storage areas.
